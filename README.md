Known issues:

-sometimes wallpapers may occasionally coinside between monitors


IF ANY ARE FOUND, FEEL FREE TO OPEN AN ISSUE, BUT DON'T EXPECT TO FIX IT IMMEDIATELY

If you got any insights for fellow newb, feel free to use pull requests, I suppose (I don't actually know how Github works, and the whole Git stuff too)
