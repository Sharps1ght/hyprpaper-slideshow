This script picks a random picture from selected directory as a wallpaper on your connected and set up monitor.

Known issues:

-sometimes wallpapers may occasionally coinside between monitors

IF ANY ARE FOUND, FEEL FREE TO OPEN AN ISSUE, BUT DON'T EXPECT TO FIX IT IMMEDIATELY

If you got any insights for fellow newb or want to dunk on what I have written, feel free to use pull requests, I suppose (I don't actually know how Github works, and the whole Git stuff too)
